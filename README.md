# Soft-ToggleSneak

This is a variation to the classic ToggleSneak mods. Here you can not only Toggle sneak, but also tell the mod how long you need to press shift to Toggle sneaking. You can also have some conditions, that make you stop sneaking. Like being in lava/water, or trying to fly in creative. All options are togglable.

Original idea by: [Zebra's ToggleSneak](https://shotbow.net/forum/threads/zebras-togglesneak-for-minecraft-1-8-1-10-2.342553/).
